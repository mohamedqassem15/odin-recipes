        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)            </li>
            <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced or torn</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually around 475-500°F or 245-260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it's preheating.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. If you're using a pizza peel and stone, transfer the rolled-out dough to the peel, ensuring it can slide easily onto the hot stone in the oven.</li>
            <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
            <li>Arrange the fresh mozzarella slices or torn pieces evenly on top of the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven or onto the hot pizza stone. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Once out of the oven, drizzle the pizza with extra-virgin olive oil and scatter fresh basil leaves on top. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese for an extra kick.</li>
            <li>Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing, then serve and savor the authentic taste of a homemade Margherita Pizza. Buon Appetito!</li>
